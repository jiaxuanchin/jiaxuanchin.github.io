                  <p>I was born in December 2002 in Singapore and studied in St. Hilda's Primary School, Nanyang Girls' High School and Hwa Chong Institution. I'm currently studying Information Systems in SMU! <br><br>

                      I never knew what I wanted to do in the future, until I had to think about it after I took my 'A' Levels. Upon finding out that a few of my friends were self-learning simple programming languages, I decided to try it as well. I attempted to learn some basic Python syntax. Although many deemed Python as the easiest programming language, I struggled at first as I could not understand how or why the statements were executed in a certain way. However, after watching many introductory videos on Python, I slowly found myself understanding and enjoying Python. I often found myself typing away on VS Code, attempting to write simple but fun games in my Python script.<br><br>
                          
                      On a lighter note, my hobbies are sailing and listening to music. I have been sailing since I was in Primary 2, and it has become a favourite pasttime of mine! I find that the gentle rocking of my boat on a warm and breezy day helps to relieve stress, and the beautiful view of the East Coast sea never ceases to amaze me. I generally listen to pop music (unfortunately, only English and Korean), but I love listening to the oldies as well. <br><br>
