        <p>I was born on 21 December 2002 in Singapore. I studied in St. Hilda's Primary School, Nanyang Girls' High School and Hwa Chong Institution. I'm an 'A' Level graduate who is currently studying Information Systems in SMU! <br><br>
            
        My hobbies are sailing, watching YouTube or K-Dramas and listening to music. I have been sailing since I was in Primary 2, and it has become a favourite pasttime of mine! I find that the gentle rocking of my boat on a warm and breezy day helps to relieve stress, and the beautiful view of the East Coast sea never ceases to amaze me. I watch a range of videos on YouTube, from cooking videos to Ocean documentaries and many more. I generally listen to pop music (unfortunately, only English and Korean), but I love listening to the oldies as well. <br><br>
