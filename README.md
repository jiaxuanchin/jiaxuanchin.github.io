<h1> Jia Xuan's wesbite</h1>
<p>The purpose of this wesbite is for me to put all the skills that I have learnt to good use. Additionally, this is a fun way for me to relax and enjoy programming without needing to stress about submitting school work before the deadline.</p>

<h4>25 Aug 2022</h4>
<p>First created this website with the title 'Hi this is Jia Xuan'.</p>

<h4>31 Aug 2022</h4>
<p> First edited my website by adding a h1 header and my biography.</p>

<h4>10 Sept 2022</h4>
<p>Used CSS to beautify my header and biography. Added a list of countries I wanted to visit and an introductory video of the places I wanted to go. Faced some issues with autoplaying the video while it was muted.</p>

<h4>14 Sept 2022</h4>
<p>Implemented some Bootstrap to make my website even nicer. Added a target='_blank' for when users click on my LinkedIn or Instagram page. New form created for users to sign up to travel with me. Tried fixing autoplay and mute video issues, but I couldn't.</p>

<h4>6 Oct 2022</h4>
<p>Update: managed to fix the autoplay at mute for youtube video</p>
<p>Made massive changes, such as creating a navigation bar, moving my intro into an accordion, and creating new pages. I added a 'travel.html', 'sailing.html' and 'others.html', though I still havent thought of what to put in. Used javascript to create a constantly updating clock, which changes background based on the time of the day. (8.30pm- 7 Oct 12.30am)</p>

<h4>14 Oct 2022</h4>
<p>Made massive changes, again. Added magic 8 ball to others.html. Copied the css of how to create the 8 ball, however I typed out all the javascript codes from scratch. Redid the background of all pages to make it look nicer. (2.45pm-5.15pm)</p>
