<h1> Jia Xuan's wesbite</h1>
<p>The purpose of this wesbite is for me to put all the skills that I have learnt to good use. Additionally, this is a fun way for me to relax and enjoy programming without needing to stress about submitting school work before the deadline.</p>

<h4>25 Aug 2022</h4>
<p>First created this website with the title 'Hi this is Jia Xuan'.</p>

<h4>31 Aug 2022</h4>
<p> First edited my website by adding a h1 header and my biography.</p>

<h4>10 Sept 2022</h4>
<p>Used CSS to beautify my header and biography. Added a list of countries I wanted to visit and an introductory video of the places I wanted to go. Faced some issues with autoplaying the video while it was muted.</p>

<h4>14 Sept 2022</h4>
<p>Implemented some Bootstrap to make my website even nicer. Added a target='_blank' for when users click on my LinkedIn or Instagram page. New form created for users to sign up to travel with me. Tried fixing autoplay and mute video issues, but I couldn't.</p>
