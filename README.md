<h1> Jia Xuan's wesbite</h1>
<p>The purpose of this wesbite is for me to put all the skills that I have learnt to good use. Additionally, this is a fun way for me to relax and enjoy programming without needing to stress about submitting school work before the deadline.</p>

<h3>25 Aug 2022</h3>
<p>First created this website with the title 'Hi this is Jia Xuan'</p>

<h3>31 Aug 2022 update:</h3>
<p> First edited my website by adding a h1 header and my biography</p>

<h3>10 Sept 2022</h3>
<p>Used CSS to beautify my header and biography. Added a list of countries I wanted to visit and an introductory video of the places I wanted to go. Faced some issues with autoplaying the video while it was muted.</p>
